# Password Strength Evaluation

## About
This project analyzes the strength of randomly generated passwords using popular online password strength checkers. It aims to illustrate password creation best practices and demonstrate the impact of complexity on security.

## Project Structure
- `PasswordStrengthReport.md` — main report and findings.
- `/screenshots` — contains password manager and strength test images.

## How to Use
1. View the report for insights into password complexity and security.
2. Check the screenshots for tool UI and password results.
3. Use the listed best practices to strengthen your own passwords.

## Key Findings
- Passwords with length 12+, diverse character sets, and symbols are strongest.
- Even long passwords are weak if they use only one character type or common patterns.
